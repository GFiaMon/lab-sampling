## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis

### Key Metric: Need for More Time
**Proportion**: 66.00%  
**95% Confidence Interval**: [52.87%, 79.13%]  
**Margin of Error**: Â±13.13%  

![Proportion with CI](./visuals/proportion_ci.png)

```python
# Margin of Error Calculation
n = 50
p = 0.66
z = 1.96  # 95% confidence
se = (p * (1 - p) / n) ** 0.5  # Standard Error
margin_error = z * se
print(f"CI: [{p - margin_error:.2%}, {p + margin_error:.2%}]")
```

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
1. **Time Pressure**: 66% feel lab hours are insufficient (Â±13% margin)
2. **Reliability**: Current sample (n=50) needs expansion to 361 for Â±5% accuracy
3. **Decision Risk**: True proportion could be as low as 53% or high as 79%
